## Uplink Functions

### requestAccessWithPassphrase(String, String, String)

#### Description

This function requestAccessWithPassphrase  requests satellite for a new access grant
using a passhprase, there is no pre-requisites required for this function.\
This function accepts 3 arguments Satellite URL, API Key and  encryptionpassphrase
and returns an access object on successful execution which can be used to 
call other functions which are bound to it.\
An access grant is a serialized structure that is internally comprised of an 
API Key, a set of encryption key information, and information about which Satellite
address is responsible for the metadata.\
An access grant is always associated with exactly one Project on one Satellite.
